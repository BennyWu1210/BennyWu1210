## Hello~ 👋

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy playing basketball, making music, and building projects that challenge me to think in new ways ✨

I also love Doraemon, the "blue cat" in my profile pic, as people call it 🐱💙

Come say hi! I would love to meet more cool people like you 😉
